Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease: An Analysis of Risk Factors
Problem
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a widespread, potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions globally. Early detection and accurate prediction of CKD are critical in improving patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and personalized treatments. However, traditional diagnostic methods are often limited, relying on subjective assessments that may not accurately predict CKD progression. This highlights the urgent need for a machine learning-based approach to improve the prediction and management of CKD by leveraging relevant risk factors and patient data.

Objective(s)
The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease. By utilizing relevant patient data and risk factors, the model aims to enhance early detection and guide personalized treatment plans, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Summary:
The README file outlines a machine learning project focused on predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD) by analyzing patient data and risk factors. It emphasizes the need for improved early detection methods beyond traditional diagnostic approaches. The objective is to create an accurate model to predict CKD onset and progression, with the potential to personalize patient treatment and improve healthcare outcomes.
